## What is your project going to be about?
It will be single-page currency converter application, which gets information about exchange rate in real-time from *[API](https://exchangeratesapi.io/)*. 
It will support most used currencies.

## What features will it consist of? Explain their purpose and try to be as granular as possible.
Our idea is to make currency converter to help people convert their money in another currency, with exchange rate (published by the *[European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/policy_and_exchange_rates/euro_reference_exchange_rates/html/index.en.html)*) valid at the moment of their willingness to change.
